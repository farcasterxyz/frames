# Getting Started

## Overview

Frames are web apps built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that use the Frames
SDK to integrate natively within a Farcaster client.

You can use your favorite web framework for developing a Frame. 


In this guide we'll use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) and
[React](https://react.dev).

## Installation

Install the Frames SDK into your project.

### Package Manager

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @farcaster/frame-sdk
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @farcaster/frame-sdk
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @farcaster/frame-sdk
```

:::

### CDN

If you're not using a package manager, you can also use the Frame SDK via an
ESM-compatible CDN such as esm.sh. Simply add a `<script type="module">` tag to
the bottom of your HTML file with the following content.

```html
<script type="module">
  import { sdk } from 'https://esm.sh/@farcaster/frame-sdk'
</script>
```

## Calling ready

When a user launches a frame, a splash screen is shown (more on this later) to
the user until the application signals that it's ready to be shown to the user:

```ts twoslash
import { sdk } from '@farcaster/frame-sdk'

// ---cut---
await sdk.actions.ready();
```

## Previewing your frame

There is a lot you can do to make an engaging social application but this is
minimum you need to do to turn your application into a frame.

Let's preview it in Warpcast:

1. Open the [Warpcast Frame Developer Tools](https://warpcast.com/~/developers/frames) on desktop
2. Enter your web app url in _Frame URL_ in the **Preview Frame** tool
3. Hit _Preview_
