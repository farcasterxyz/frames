# Publishing your app

Publishing Mini Apps involves providing information like who developed the app,
how it should be displayed, and what its capabilities are.

Since Farcaster is a decentralized network with multiple clients, publishing is
done by hosting a file at `/.well-known/farcaster.json` on the domain your app
is hosted on rather than submitting information directly to single entity.

## Choosing a domain

A Mini App is associated with a single domain (i.e. rewards.warpcast.com). This
domain serves as the identifier for your app and can't be changed later so
you'll should choose a stable domain. There's no limit on the number of apps
you can create, so you can optionally use a separate domain for development.

:::note
A domain does not include the scheme (e.g. https) or path. It can optionally
include a subdomain.
- ✅ rewards.warpcast.com
- ❌ https://rewards.warpcast.com

## Verifying ownership

A Mini App is owned by a single Farcaster account. This lets users know who
they are interacting with and developers get credit for their work.

Verification is done by placing a cryptographically signed message in your
`farcaster.json` file that associates the domain with a Farcaster account. 

We'll generate this verification below.


## App Profile 

A Mini App has metadata that is used by Farcaster clients to host your apps.
This data is also provided in `farcaster.json`.


## Generating `farcaster.json`

You can generate both the verification and profile compoents of this file
including the signature using the [Farcaster JSON
Tool](https://warpcast.com/~/developers/new) in Warpcast. 

Take the generated file and host it on your domain at
`/.well-known/farcaster.json`.

:::warning
The domain you host the file on must exactly match the domain you entered in
the Warpcast tool.
